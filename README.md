## 📌 Project Overview

The **World of Science Museum** is a static web project designed to provide visitors with
detailed information about museum exhibitions and scientific displays in a clean,
interactive, and user-friendly way.

To support exhibition navigation, a **separate QR Code Generator page** is included,
allowing QR codes to be generated for specific exhibitions or media content.
This feature is implemented using front-end technologies due to the absence of backend integration.

Note:
This project currently does not include a backend or admin authentication system.
The QR code generator is ADDED as a separate static page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
and can be accessed and launched independently by authorized users if required.
