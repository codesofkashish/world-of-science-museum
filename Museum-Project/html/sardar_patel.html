        <h2>A Pillar of India’s Foundation</h2>
        <p>
            Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel stands among the foremost architects of modern India.
            A leader of extraordinary determination and discipline, Patel played a decisive role
            in shaping India’s political unity during one of the most fragile moments in its history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Known as the “Iron Man of India,” his strength did not lie in aggression, but in unwavering resolve,
            administrative clarity, and an unshakeable commitment to national integration.

            <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
            <p>
                Vallabhbhai Patel was born on 31 October 1875 in Nadiad, Gujarat, into a humble farming family.
                From a young age, he exhibited qualities of independence, discipline, and self-reliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                He pursued his education with remarkable determination, later traveling to England to study law.
                Returning as a barrister, Patel established himself as a successful lawyer before answering
                the call of the freedom movement.

    <section class="freedom reveal">
        <h2>Role in India’s Freedom Struggle</h2>
        <p>
            Sardar Patel emerged as a mass leader during the Kheda and Bardoli Satyagrahas.
            His leadership during the Bardoli movement earned him the title “Sardar,” a mark
            of respect from the people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working closely with Mahatma Gandhi, Patel emphasized discipline, organization,
            and constructive resistance. His ability to mobilize farmers and negotiate with
            British authorities demonstrated his rare blend of firmness and diplomacy.

            <img src="../images/sardar-3.jpg" alt="Integration of Princely States">
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Integration of Princely States</h2>
            <p>
                Patel’s greatest contribution came after independence, when India faced the daunting
                task of integrating over 560 princely states into a single nation.
            </p>
            <p>
                As India’s first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, he employed a pragmatic
                approach — combining persuasion, assurance, and firmness — to achieve national unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without Patel’s decisive leadership, India’s territorial integrity could have been
                irreversibly fragmented.

    <section class="administration reveal">
        <h2>Administrative Vision & Governance</h2>
        <p>
            Patel laid the foundation of India’s civil services, recognizing that a strong administrative
            structure was essential for governance in a diverse nation.
        </p>
        <p>
            He believed that political freedom without administrative discipline would lead to chaos.
            His vision continues to influence India’s bureaucratic and federal framework today.

            <h2>Legacy & National Recognition</h2>
            <p>
                Sardar Patel’s legacy is not confined to history books. The Statue of Unity,
                the world’s tallest statue, stands as a tribute to his contribution and ideals.
            </p>
            <p>
                His life serves as a reminder that unity, discipline, and decisive leadership
                are the cornerstones of nation-building.

        <h2>The Iron Will Behind a United India</h2>
        <p>
            Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was not merely a political leader — he was a nation-builder.
            His courage lay in making difficult decisions for the greater good.
        </p>
        <p>
            In understanding Patel, we understand the strength that binds India together.
